                                    <p>Actually, <em>the opposite</em>. You are directly contributing to everyone's

                                        you are also increasing your privacy beyond what privacy regulations in most
                                        places require. <em>This exceeds what companies are required by law to do
                                            today!</em> It is a consent-based system. Your workers/customers have the
                                        freedom to share your information to a valid inspector or refuse, on a
                                        case-by-case basis.</p><br />
                                    <p>Immunodex contributes to your workers/customers' safety by letting
                                        policy makers in a company or government know about the health of their people
                                        in a timely and reliable manner. In order to do this, the "paper trail" of the
                                        health records must be traceable. This trail rightfully belongs to the
                                        individual. But right now, it does not. It sits on clinics' computers or the
                                        hospital's servers, or the government has it. You have no access to your own
                                        health data, but we let you hold your own data. Finally, the inspection is not
                                        only consent-based, but requires a minimum exchange of information, which means
                                        your workers/customers might not need to reveal ALL data, but simply fulfil the
                                        requirements of you the inspector (this is "zero-knowledge proof").</p>

                                        urgent. New research and findings do not invalidate records on Immunodex. In
                                        fact, reliable records <em>contribute</em> to ongoing research.</p>

                                    <p>No, Immunodex does not store any information.</p>
                                    <p>Most other solutions out there are built using a conventional database structure, which you can imagine as a honeypot full of valuable personal (health-related) information. Naturally, this honeypot attracts hackers if there is a payload inside. Even if encrypted, hackers can figure out ways to breach the database, and resell the information or use it for malicious purposes.</p>
                                    <p>Immunodex does not rely on databases. Rather, our system is built on a cryptographically-secured distributed ledger (a.k.a. blockchain), meaning there is no single centralized database (the "honeypot") for hackers to breach. Moreover, what's stored on the distributed ledger is hashed data, which cannot be un-hashed (made into usable information) without your private key that is specific to your own user account. Hence, your information is stored only with you (until you consent to share it with an external party), and you are the guardian of your own data.</p>

                                        (location is the Holder's choice). A back-up is an encrypted file that is an

                                    <p>Covid ALERT is not designed for <em>institutional</em> contact-tracing. For example, institutions cannot actively prevent risky or "non-compliant" people from entering their premises. Covid ALERT is solely meant to alert <em>individuals</em> when they have been exposed to a positive-testing person (the status of whom must be voluntarily self-uploaded).</p>
                                    <p>Immunodex is meant for <em>institutions</em> (such as schools and businesses) who need to monitor the health of their clients, staff and teams in a private and secure way. We help prevent outbreaks before they can occur. Please <a href="/request-for-demo.html">contact us to see a demo</a></p>
                                    <p>This is not to say that Covid ALERT is useless. We see Immunodex as being <em>complementary</em> to contact-tracing apps, as another weapon in the arsenal to protect ourselves from outbreaks. However, we make sure that our usage of data in this fight is verifiable, private and responsible.</p>
